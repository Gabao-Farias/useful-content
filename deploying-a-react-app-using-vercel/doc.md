  <h1>Automating the Deploy of a React App Using Vercel</h1>
</div>

## Step-by-step
Okay this will be a fast step-by-step tutorial showing how to automate a React app deploy

## Repo
So first of all, get a repo for the app in Github, or, if you already have one, you can use it too.

## App
If you already have your app ready to go, go to the next step and if you don't, well... what are you waiting for??? Go on, create it!

## Vercel
Now register yourself in Vercel and import your Github project there.

* You may permit Vercel to access this repository, but be careful, in the first time Vercel will ask if it can access all repos in your account, I've chosen to free access only specifics repo, but this is your decision;

* After that you click on install, and wait for the build;

* When it's all done, you don't need to get back to Vercel all the time that you want to make an update, you just need to push your code and it will make all again automatically;
